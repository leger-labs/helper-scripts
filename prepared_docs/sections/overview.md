## Overview

Open WebUI provides a large range of environment variables that allow you to customize and configure
various aspects of the application. This page serves as a comprehensive reference for all available
environment variables, providing their types, default values, and descriptions.
As new variables are introduced, this page will be updated to reflect the growing configuration options.

:::info

This page is up-to-date with Open WebUI release version [v0.6.9](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/releases/tag/v0.6.9), but is still a work in progress to later include more accurate descriptions, listing out options available for environment variables, defaults, and improving descriptions.

### Important Note on `PersistentConfig` Environment Variables

:::note

When launching Open WebUI for the first time, all environment variables are treated equally and can be used to configure the application. However, for environment variables marked as `PersistentConfig`, their values are persisted and stored internally.

After the initial launch, if you restart the container, `PersistentConfig` environment variables will no longer use the external environment variable values. Instead, they will use the internally stored values.

In contrast, regular environment variables will continue to be updated and applied on each subsequent restart.

You can update the values of `PersistentConfig` environment variables directly from within Open WebUI, and these changes will be stored internally. This allows you to manage these configuration settings independently of the external environment variables.

Please note that `PersistentConfig` environment variables are clearly marked as such in the documentation below, so you can be aware of how they will behave.
